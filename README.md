# Crate Kubernetes Scalechecker

This is an experimental tool that I developed during the [Kubernetes Birthday Hackathon](https://crate.io/a/happy-birthday-kubernetes/) at the Endocode Office.

**At the moment it is a 100 % experimental.**

It aims to adopt the Scaling of the Kubernetes Cluster to Crate by setting different settings that rely on the Cluster size. And at the moment it does it by polling.
